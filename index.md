# Obstacle avoiding robot
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was assembling the parts of the robot and make sure that they worked individually. The robot parts consisted of wheels along with the wheel motors, servo, motor driver, and ultrasonic sensor. I had issues with the ultrasonic sensor due to incorrect code as well as issues with downloading the library.

# Starter Project

My starter project was a customizable Arduino project that consisted of an IR breakbeam and a servo motor. When the IR breakbeam detects an object like a hand, this info will be sent to the servo where it will move 170 degrees
