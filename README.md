This robot avoids obstacles by detection to an ultrasonic sensor, which can detect objects through sound waves. The ultrasonic sensor is attached to a servo by a 3D printed attachment. This information gets transferred to an Arduino UNO that will make a decision whether or not an object has been detected. Then with the motor driver being connected to the Arduino, the motor driver will receive the information and turn accordingly. To break down the code: the robot starts by moving forward. The distance from the closest object will be returned. If the distance of this object is less than 40 cm, the servo will turn the ultrasonic sensor left and right while getting distances from both sides. If the distance on left side is greater than 40 cm, the robot will turn in that direction. Otherwise the servo will move ultrasonic sensor to the right side and if that distance is less than 40 cm, the robot will turn. If there's an object in both directions, the robot will back up and check the distances again.
